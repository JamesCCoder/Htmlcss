              <h2>Our history</h2>
              <p>
                For many years, <b>Bethany</b> has been baking the most delicious pies at her home. <br><br>In 2013, we opened our first
                store in <i>Brussels (Belgium)</i> in a cosy little street near the Grand Market. People from all over the world fell in love
                with the soft cakes, heavenly cheese cakes, spicy apple pies... The store became a success in no time.
                <br><br>In 2015, no less than 100 pies were sold every day and Bethany's Pie Shop moved into a larger building.
                After receiving many requests, it became clear that our next step was making it possible to order pies from the
                comfort of your own home and from anywhere in the world. You are now looking at the result of this: our very own
                webstore, making it possible to order Bethany's delicious pies whenever you feel like it!
            </p>
            <p>
                Bethany is famousfor using only the best ingredients. This way, we can make sure that our pies are absolutely the best.

rules of float

1. float makes element be out of "normal flow"
2. first floating element will just be down the prior element
3. second floating element will just follow the first one(right -> down)
4. the rest elements that not floated will follow the original rules

all: float element: start point from (1. prior is float: right-> down  2.prior is normal: down)

tip: use "width = ?%" to adjust the element with "float"
